# ClickableRaidBuffs v7.1.15 Release Notes

- Hardened aura handling against secret values to prevent repeated `table index is secret` errors
- Applied secret-safe guards across Food Status, Raid Buff scanning, Trinkets, Fixed Target, and core buff expiry lookups
- Added explicit `expansionId` metadata to all consumable entries so expansion filters apply consistently
