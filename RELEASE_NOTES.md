# ClickableRaidBuffs v7.1.11 Release Notes

- Fixed player buff detection regressions that caused food, flask, and raid buff reminders to appear while buffs were already active
- Fixed range gate logic so out-of-range missing raid-buff targets are suppressed correctly and in-range targets continue to show reminders
